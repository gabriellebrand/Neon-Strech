Neon Stretch is an electrifying endless runner set in a synthwave world where you control a shape-shifting box racing through a vibrant landscape. As retro beats pulse through the air, youâ€™ll need to stretch and scale to dodge incoming walls hurled at high speed. The intensity builds as the music escalates and the pace quickens, challenging your reflexes and timing as you aim to survive in this mesmerizing, retro-futuristic arcade game.

The game was developed using the Godot Engine and the assets were created using GIMP. The music was composed using PICO-8.
The font "Arcade Classic" used in the game was created by Yuji Adachi.
