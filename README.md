Neon Stretch is an electrifying endless runner set in a synthwave world where you control a shape-shifting box racing through a vibrant landscape. As retro beats pulse through the air, youâ€™ll need to stretch and scale to dodge incoming walls hurled at high speed. Your score multiplier increases the longer you avoid walls, and the intensity builds as the music escalates, pushing you to stretch your limits to achieve the highest possible score.

The game was developed using the Godot Engine and the assets were created using GIMP. The music was composed using PICO-8.
The font "Arcade Classic" used in the game was created by Yuji Adachi.
